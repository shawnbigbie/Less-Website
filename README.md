# preprocessing-project-DGM-2780

You are to demonstrate that you know how to use basic HTML and CSS by building a responsive two page webpage for one of these three companies:

*Road Warriors* - Bike shop

*Cozy Corner* - Book store

*Calm Mind* - Spa

You will use one of these companies as a guide for your content.  For design, you will need to find a website that you admire as a guide for layout.  You will then combine the company content and the layout of the website you admire to create a single page marketing site.

## Project Requirements

These project requirements directly impact the grading rubric, so read them carefully:

- [ ] Pick one of the three companies in the project description as your client

- [ ] Pick which website you admire to mimic for layout, you will provide the URL at the bottom of the readme file

- [ ] Utilize imports so that only one file is compiled from at least 4 imported files

- [ ] Build a 2 page web page based on your decided client and layout.  Your final website must closely match the website layout that you admired

- [ ] Utilize variables for a font stack and colors

- [ ] Create a mobile version of the home and secondary pages using escaped variables.  You can simply stack your content on top of itself, nothing complex is expected

- [ ] Nest your selectors so that they match the HTML structure

- [ ] Create and use 2 unique mixins of your choice

- [ ] Create a mixin that creates a custom button using parameters.  Apply these styles on the buttons you created in HTML for the home and services page

- [ ] Your project must be submitted via git

## Project Resources

Images and content can be frustrating to find and use in any project.  To alleviate your time on design, consider using these resources so you can focus on the code:

- For copyright free images, you can use [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/)

- For filler text use a [lorem ipsum generator](https://www.lipsum.com/)
